I’m a designer & entrepreneur working on digital products. I design with a dev/product/business mindset. It feels obvious as a designer to understand these disciplines to interact with users and the team to identify opportunities and create premium quality products. I had the incredible opportunity to lead the design work of several extraordinary startups.

I currently work as a freelancer.
For the last 8 years, I had the privilege to work for renowned startups in really challenging projects. As Principal Designer at Blackpills, I designed the multi-device user experience to distribute Blackpills’ own produced series. From driving the product to designing micro-interactions, the challenge was to keep consistency between all our platforms and content while designing a completely new experience in that industry. The Blackpills community of millions of users rated the service up to 4.7 on the app stores.

As Designer for Kayrros, I had the objective to rethink the Energy Industry and its billions of data points to make it accessible and understandable to everyone. Prior to that, I was a Partner at Flat.io, a platform targeting musicians and compositors and Lead Designer at Soundrop & Show.co, reinventing music marketing and social interactions.

As a Freelancer, I currently focused on helping companies create an amazing design experience for their product, reorganize their UX Department and/or implement best practices on « How to implement « Scale » in UX / UI ».
